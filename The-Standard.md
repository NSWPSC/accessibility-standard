# Digital Accessibility Standard

The Digital Accessibility Standard is a set of rules about our approach digital accessibility. Following the rule means we can make sure that everyone is included when we provide information and services in digital formats. It helps us ensure that our products meet a wide range of people’s needs when designing, developing and delivering digital projects.

1. Allow for assistive methods
1. Test, validate and verify
1. Report, fix and review

### Put people first

Start with identifying user needs. If you don’t know what the user needs are, you won’t create the right thing. Do research, analyse data and talk to users. Don’t make assumptions. Have empathy for users and remember that what they ask for isn’t always what they need.

When designing, developing and delivering digital services, follow the design principles in the [Australian Government’s Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-principles/) and [the standards for usability from the United States Government](https://guidelines.usability.gov/).

#### How do you know if you’re putting people first? 
Key questions to ask
- Can people easily complete key tasks?
- How quickly can people complete those tasks?
- Can people complete the task on their first try?
- What distractions or barriers do people face? Can you remove those?
- After using the service once, can a person remember enough to use it effectively the next time?
- How much do people like using your service?

### Design for everyone

Accessible design is good design. 

Everything we build should be as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. If we have to sacrifice elegance - so be it. We’re building for needs, not audiences. We’re designing for the all people, not just the ones who are used to using the web. The people who most need our services are often the people who find them hardest to use. Let’s think about those people from the start.


### Adhere to WCAG
The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php) are used widely around the world as a benchmark for web accessibility.

Australian governments must adhere – at a minimum – to WCAG 2.0 Level AA.

But our goal is to take our digital accessibility beyond WCAG, in particular, by carefully considering the needs of people with cognitive disability.

WCAG has four main principles:

- **Perceivable** – Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- **Operable** – User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- **Understandable** – Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
- **Robust** – Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents.

For each principle, there are a list of criteria that need to be met to make sure your online content is accessible. There are 38 techniques in total.

The [‘How to meet WCAG’](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref) quick reference guide is a helpful starting point.

To know that you adhere to WCAG you neeed to test, validate and verify. When you find areas where you don't adher you need to go through a process of reporting, fixing and reviewing.

### Know the content types

At FACS, there are a range of content types. Knowing these types allows us to apply usability and accessibility for all of our audiences. It also helps us understand when we should apply various accessibility techniques.

For example, every single PDF that we publish must be accessible. However, you don’t always need to provide a plain English version of every document or web page – especially if you are publishing an academic text. However, plain English summaries are helpful.

Knowing your content types goes hand in hand with knowing your audience. Then you can work toward providing content that meets your user’s needs.

#### What are the content types?
##### Apps
When designing and developing apps for mobile or desktop use, all accessibility requirements apply. The W3C article on mobile accessibility is a good starting point. Include all the criteria in the Standard when designing and developing content for apps, including putting people first, designing for everyone, adhering to WCAG, testing with users and writing in plain English.

##### Documents
Documents include everything from legislation to fact sheets. They can generally be divided into documents for viewing and documents for editing.

All documents that you communicate digitally must be accessible. This means any time they're to be published on a public website, or on an internal web system like an intranet. You should also make sure any document you're sharing widely via email or through other digital channels is accessible.

HTML is the most accessible format and should be used wherever possible.

Alternative formats should be provided when publishing a document as a PDF, because of known issues on mobile devices. Never publish scanned PDFs unless an alternative is provided.

All PDFs should be tagged and have accompanying short summaries.

The best starting point for an accessible document is the template. If a template is accessible, the process of ensuring that the final document is accessible becomes easier.

Most documents should be written in plain English, and long documents should be broken down if possible. However, each business area will need to make an informed decision about writing academic, legal or research material in plain English. Evaluation of the needs of the audience will be critical in each instance. Plain English summaries toward the top of a web page are a great way to help a reader decide if they will access the full content of a longer document or article. Glossaries or word lists also help.

Some fact sheets or other external communications might require translation into a range of languages, or an Easy Read version. Please see providing alternative formats for more information.

##### Forms
Forms should be clear and easy to use. You must consider the way the form will be used and the language that you use to explain the steps in completing the form.

The accessibility of the form must be taken into consideration at a technical level and you should follow the WCAG techniques for creating accessible forms. This article from Web AIM has some great advice on how to do this.

###### Graphics and data
Graphics should be clear and easy to understand. Check that the correct colour contrast ratio has been used. And remember that alternative text must be provided.

When writing alternative text for online content, you need to keep your description brief – preferably under 100 characters. However, if you have a complex diagram or graph that has multiple concepts, you must describe these. If 100 characters is not enough to describe the content effectively, a text description of the content can be provided in a link. When writing alternative content in a program like Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign, you can provide longer descriptions.

##### Presentations
You can make your presentations accessible by following the guidance for colour contrast and the provision of alternative text on images, graphs and data. If you wish to publish your presentation online, a good way to do this is to provide an accessible PDF, as well as the PowerPoint file if possible.

##### Research
Research reports and papers, evaluation studies and literature reviews may be long and unwieldy for non-specialised readers. When publishing this kind of material on our intranet or public-facing websites, it is important to provide a plain English summary describing what the content is about in a clear and succinct way. Readers can then decide if they would like to read the document. The document itself should be published in an accessible format, with an alternative to PDF provided.

##### Social media
Unfortunately, the accessibility of third-party social media platforms is out of our hands. However, we can take steps to make sure that our use of social media considers the needs of our audience. For example, we can ensure that all of the videos we publish and share are captioned.

We can also make sure that all of the documents we share publically are accessible – that means that if someone shares a file, or a link to a file, we know that the widest range of people will be able to use it.

When people follow links to our websites, we can make sure that the web pages are accessible and that alternative formats are available.

##### Web pages
Web page content should be presented in clear, easy to understand text that is broken up into digestible chunks with good, descriptive headings. Providing plain English summaries about complex information is a helpful way to connect with your website visitor and let them decide if they’d like to read more.

##### Videos
Videos are a great way to communicate but they are not accessible to everyone if alternatives – such as captions – are not provided. At FACS, we provide captioning as a minimum, and audio description and Auslan translations in some circumstances. Find out more about the criteria for providing alternative formats here.

### Write in plain English
Plain English is the difference between this:

_We are working to make your job easier by giving you access to communicate with us electronically through a new service provider view of our online portal._ (27 words)

and this:

_The new service provider view of the portal makes it easier for you to communicate with us._ (17 words)

You should use the language that is appropriate to your audience. Generally this should be plain English, however there may be a business case for including technical or legal language. This may mean you will need to write the same content in a different way for a different user base. The rule is to make language as simple as its users need.

There is lots of guidance on how to write in plain English:

- Plain Language Australia
- Plain English Foundation
- Plain Language Action and Information Network’s guide to simple words and phrases

Follow the [Style guide for digital content](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-guides/online-writing/)'s rule of thumb and **make your communication as simple as its users need**.


#### Write in active voice
A sentence is in the active voice when the agent of the action (that is, the person or thing doing something) appears in front of the verb.

For example:

> John Smith (agent) ate (verb) the grape (target).

This sentence shows you clearly and immediately who is doing the action.

A sentence is in the passive voice when the target of the verb appears in front of the verb.

For example:

> The grape (target) was eaten (verb) by John Smith (agent).

Active voice clearly identifies who is doing what to whom, is more immediate and generally uses fewer words. Try using the first and second person instead of the third person to help you to write in the active voice.

#### Personalise content
Make your content more personal by using the first and second person pronouns I, we, us and you rather than third-person nouns (such as Australian Government Department of Finance) and pronouns (he, she, it and they).

Instead of:

> If the author is having difficulty creating content using markdown, the web policy team can provide further guidance.

Write:

> If you are having difficulty creating content using markdown, we can provide further guidance.

#### Be inclusive
Language is discriminatory if it:

- excludes people or makes them invisible to the reader
- focuses on a single characteristic to the exclusion of other more relevant ones
- stereotypes people
- insults or denigrates people
- treats some people differently from others.

The [Style guide for digital content](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-guides/inclusive-services/) provides more guidance on being inclusive in your writing.


### Make sure PDFs are accessible
Every PDF that you publish online or send electronically should be accessible. However, even if your documents meets these checks you can't rely on PDF alone. You must also provide alternatives to PDFs when you publish online or send electronically. This is largely because:

- Not all versions of all screen readers read out PDFs consistently.
- PDF does not currently have accessibility support on mobile devices.

You can find out how to check the accessibility of a PDF in the guidance [Accessible PDFs - How to publish on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/accessible-pdfs)

#### Avoid publishing as PDF
Don’t publish your document as a PDF if it is four pages or shorter. Instead publish the content as a web page. 

Documents over four pages can be published as an accessible PDF with an accompanying alternative format, such as HTML or an open document format. 

#### Create an accessible document in PDF/A format

An accessible PDF has, at minimum:
- the correct heading structure
- text alternatives for images
- a document title
- the language identified
- the correct colour contrast levels in use
- hyperlinks that are displayed with meaningful text – apply the link to the text, avoid repetitive text such as ‘Read more’ and avoid long web links/URLs
- a table of contents, linking to the correct sections of the document
- bullet points for the presentation of information in lists
- tables used to contain data and with header rows specified
- a  reading that ensures content flows correctly when read out by a screen reader.

The best way to create an accessible PDF is to create an accessible source document.

When a source document is converted into PDF it’s tagged. The PDF tag tree reflects the structure of the document, and it’s this structure that assistive technologies like screen readers use to navigate the document.

##### In Microsoft Word
Use the styles and features available in Word to format your content and give it structure. This will make it easier to convert your source document into PDF because it lays the groundwork for the PDF tag tree.

###### Use headings
Use the heading styles in Word to create a logical document structure. Don’t increase the size of text or make it bold to create the appearance of headings.

Treat your document like a book: It should have one title (level one heading) and multiple chapters (level 2 headings). Within each chapter there may be multiple sections (level 3 headings) and sub sections (level 4 headings).

###### Use lists
Use the list styles in Word to group together related items. If the items follow a specific sequence, use a numbered list instead. Don’t use punctuation or other markers to create the illusion of a list.

###### Create a table of contents
If your document is longer than a few pages, use Word to automatically create a table of contents based on your heading structure. Don’t use lists and links to manually create a table of contents.

###### Use readable body text
Use left aligned text (unless the language of your document is read right to left). Don’t use justified text in your document.

Choose a sans serif font and use the styles in Word to set it as the default, with a minimum size of 12pt. If you need to include footnotes or other text of a smaller size, increase the size of the body text to 14pt, rather than reduce the size of text below 12pt.

Don’t use chunks of italicised or capitalised text, and don’t underline text unless it’s a link.

###### Write accurate, descriptive link text
Use an accurate description of the content you link to as the link text.

Avoid non-informative link phrases such as: click here, read more, link to [some link destination], etc.


###### Use good colour contrast
Use foreground and background colours for text that have a good contrast ratio. 4.5:1 ratio recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 is a good minimum.

Don’t use colour or shape as the only way to identify something in your document. Use text labels or descriptions instead.

###### Use data tables
Use tables with column headings to display data. Don’t use tables to make cosmetic changes to the layout of the document.

###### Provide text descriptions
Use Word to add text descriptions to all important images in the document. Make sure the text description includes all the information contained within, or conveyed by, the image.

##### In Adobe Acrobat
Use Adobe Acrobat Pro to convert your Word document into PDF. Use the Convert to PDF option under the Adobe menu in Microsoft Word to do this. This will make sure that Acrobat picks up the accessibility you have built into your source document.

###### Set the document language
Set the language of the document. Go to ‘File’, then ‘Properties’ then ‘Advanced’ and select a language from the ‘Language’ menu.

###### Check the tag tree
All content must be tagged, marked as an artefact (background content), or removed from the tag tree. Use the Tags panel to review and edit the tag tree. If the PDF was converted from a well structured Word document, the tag tree should require little editing.

###### Check the tab order
If the PDF contains form fields, use ‘Advanced’ then ‘Accessibility’ then ‘Touch up reading order’ to check they can be navigated with the tab key in a logical order. If the tab order needs improving, use the Order panel to drag and drop the fields into the correct order.

###### Check the reading order
Use the Tags panel to review and edit the reading order of the PDF. Don’t rely on the visual order of the PDF. The reading order is based on the structure of the PDF tag tree, which may not match the visual content order.

###### Check the reflow order
Use ‘View’ then ‘Zoom reflow’ then check that the PDF still has a logical reading order. Note: It can sometimes be difficult to guarantee a logical reflow order for PDfs with complex content.

###### Check text descriptions
Go to ‘Advanced’ then ‘Accessibility’ then ‘Touch up reading order’ and check that all images have text descriptions. If the text descriptions were present in the source Word document and the Convert to PDF option was used, the text descriptions should already be present in the PDF.

###### Remove empty tags
Remove empty tags from the tag tree. Use the Tags panel to highlight and delete any empty tags from the tag tree.

###### Set decorative content
Tag decorative content elements as artefacts. Use ‘Advanced’ then ‘Accessibility’ then ‘Touch up reading order’ to select a decorative element, and use the Background button to make the element an artefact.

###### Check data tables
Use the Tags panel to check the structure of data tables. The ‘table’, ‘tr’ and ‘td’ tags should be used to give data tables the proper structure.

###### Active links
Use the Tags panel to check that links are active. Active links should be tagged with the ‘link’ tag.

###### Check high contrast
Use ‘File’ then ‘Preference’ then ‘Accessibility’ to set a high contrast colour scheme, and check the PDF remains readable. Note: It may not be possible to make high contrast mode work in all PDFs, in which case you should be prepared to make a high contrast version available on request.

###### Display document title
Display the document title instead of the file name. Go to ‘File’ then ‘Properties’ then ‘Initial view’ and select Document title from the Show drop down box.

### Provide documents in open formats

Citizens, businesses and government officials need to be able to access and read government documents on their own devices. Documents in this context include word processed texts, spreadsheets and presentations.

It's important to remember that:
- not everyone is using the latest version of the software that you might be using in your work, or they may not own proprietary software like Microsoft Office.

#### Documents designed to be viewed
Documents designed to be viewed are meant to be read, rather than edited or interacted with.

These documents must be available in one or both of the following formats:

- HTML5 (the language web pages are built with), eg HTML publications
- PDF/A that has been formatted to be accessible

#### Documents designed to be edited
Documents designed to be edited (eg statistics, spreadsheets) are meant to be interacted with, or used for collaborative working, not just read.

This type of document must be published in:

- .odt for text documents
- .ods for spreadsheets
- .odp for presentations

#### Data
Datasets are files designed to be machine readable by external software.

If you need to publish structured data like tables or spreadsheets, you should use:

- .ods - an open format that can be used in free, open or proprietary licensed software
- .csv - a machine-readable format which enables users to process the data it contains

Avoid publishing statistical tables or datasets within a PDF or other format designed mainly for text. This is because it makes it difficult for visually impaired users who rely on screenreaders. Instead, try to provide them separately using .ods or .csv.

### Provide alternative formats
Allowing flexibility and control to rest with the user is at the heart of providing alternative formats.

Alternative types of content should be simultaneously published wherever possible. As a last resort, you must offer to provide these upon request.

It’s important to remember that: 
- not everyone uses digital content in the same way. 
- some people use assistive technology, such as screen readers, mobile apps and magnifying software to help them access digital content. There are vast differences in the way these kinds of tools operate and we can’t be sure that every product we produce will be used the same way with each tool. For this reason, alternative formats are essential.

Similarly, some people with sensory disability require alternative formats that meet their needs. For example, some people require Braille versions of text, audio files that read content aloud, or text descriptions of audio content.

And some people with a range of disabilities, learning needs and cognitive conditions such as dyslexia require content in a simple, clear format like plain English or Easy Read. Alternative fonts and large text sizes can be incredibly helpful in some situations.


#### Video
Videos must be published with captions, and where appropriate audio descriptions and Auslan should be used. Use plain english in your videos. It is a good idea to consider accessibility when writing your script.

Captions are the text version of speech and other audible content that appears on videos. Captions:
- are used to communicate with people who are Deaf or hearing impaired 
- help people access your content in noisy environments 
- and assist in teaching or training others who are learning English.

Audio description is an audible narration of visual representations such as television programs, films and live performances. During gaps of dialogue it describes visual elements such as scenes, settings, actions and costumes to the viewer. Audio description is useful to people who are blind or who have low vision and people who have print, learning and/or physical disabilities.

Auslan is the Australian sign language and it is the primary or preferred language for many people in the Australian Deaf community. When producing videos for emergency communication, such as bushfires or floods, an Auslan interpreter must be present on screen for the entire duration of the video. For other videos, where possible, include an Auslan interpreter.

#### Alternative formats for documents
Documents over four pages can be published as an accessible PDF with an accompanying alternative format, such as HTML or an open document format. 

An alternative format is required because:

- Not all versions of all screen readers read out PDFs consistently.
- PDF does not currently have accessibility support on mobile devices.

Never publish scanned PDFs unless an alternative is provided.

The best starting point for an accessible document is the template. If a template is accessible, the process of ensuring that the final document is accessible becomes easier. Use any accessible templates your organisation providers to ensure your document avoids introducing accessibility problems.

By following steps to produce an accessible Word documents if your PDF originated from a Microsoft Word document.

Follow the requirements for making sure PDFs are accessible whenever they are used.


#### Languages other than English
A benefit of some types of alternative formats is support for including content in languages other than English.
