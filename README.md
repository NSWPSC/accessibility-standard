# Digital Accessibility Standard

The Digital Accessibility Standard is a set of rules about how to approach digital accessibility.


## Why have a Standard?
The Digital Accessibility Standard is designed to make sure that everyone is included when we provide information and services in digital formats.

The Standard helps us put people first and to make sure that our products meet a wide range of people’s needs when designing, developing and delivering digital projects.

The Standard helps us meet obligations under the law, including:

- [The Disability Discrimination Act 1992](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00013)
- [The United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disability](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-2.html), which was ratified by Australia in 2008.

But we don’t just do this because we have to. We do this work because:

- We believe that every person has the right to be independent when accessing information.
- We love connecting with our community and learning from our real-world customers and their experiences.
- We’re becoming experts in accessibility and we’re passionate about achieving best-practice standards in this realm.

## Who should use the Standard?
The Digital Accessibility Standard is for everyone involved in producing work that's published digitally.

No matter what your role, the Standard is designed to help you make fast decisions about how you can create and share content while making sure it’s inclusive and accessible.

You might be creating a PDF to send to a group via email, or you might be responsible for hands-on web development. Everyone needs to understand how important digital accessibility is, and how to put it into practice.

Managers, content specialists, user experience specialists, web developers and designers all have important responsibilities in making sure that everything we publish is accessible, and in sharing their knowledge with others in their teams and across the organisation.

But this doesn’t mean that non-technical people don’t have a role to play. Anyone can take up the responsibility of checking that accessibility techniques have been applied – no matter what area you’re working in, or what level of input you may have in the production of content.

Taking an approach of shared responsibility will ultimately mean that more digital products will be accessible than ever before, and this benefits all of us.
