# Digital Accessibility Standard

The Digital Accessibility Standard is a set of rules about how to approach digital accessibility.


##Why have a Standard?
The Digital Accessibility Standard is designed to make sure that everyone is included when we provide information and services in digital formats.

The Standard helps us put people first and to make sure that our products meet a wide range of people’s needs when designing, developing and delivering digital projects.

The Standard helps us meet obligations under the law, including:

- [The Disability Discrimination Act 1992](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00013)
- [The United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disability](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-2.html), which was ratified by Australia in 2008.

But we don’t just do this because we have to. We do this work because:

- We believe that every person has the right to be independent when accessing information.
- We love connecting with our community and learning from our real-world customers and their experiences.
- We’re becoming experts in accessibility and we’re passionate about achieving best-practice standards in this realm.
